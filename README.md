# React/Angular/Vue assignment
# What is this?

The following instructions and requirements in this repository represent a step in the Northdan community onboarding process. It's a (hopefully) simple take home exercise to be later used as a conversation starter in our technical discussion. It should also help us in reducing the number of technical challenges a client wants you to go through

It is a blocker in progressing through our onboarding (please keep in mind if you have time to do it is helpful for us and this might give you an advantage over other candidates when applying for jobs)

# What it is not?

It is not meant to be an evaluation of your full skills as a professional. Also this is not in any way an assurance of a positive outcome of our internal or the clients onboarding process

- Allows users to sort the results and to filter
-- As a user I should be able to filter by year of release and by genre
-- As a user I should be able to sort by name, year of release
- Users should be able to favorite some shows and have them available after they restart the browser
-- As a user I would like to be able to favorite a number of titles and I would like those favorite to persist in the browser (local is sufficient, no need for external APIs)
