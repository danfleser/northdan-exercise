# React exercise

# What is this?

The following instructions and requirements in this repository represent a step in the Northdan community onboarding process. It's a (hopefully) simple take home exercise to be later used as a conversation starter in our technical discussion. It should also help us in reducing the number of technical challenges a client wants you to go through

It is a blocker in progressing through our onboarding (please keep in mind if you have time to do it is helpful for us and this might give you an advantage over other candidates when applying for jobs)

# What it is not?

It is not meant to be an evaluation of your full skills as a professional. Also this is not in any way an assurance of a positive outcome of our internal or the clients onboarding process

# Exercise brief

We would like you to build a React app that connects to a movie and/or tv show open api that:

- allows me to search for the title of their favorite show or display a list of all results
- allows users to sort the results and to filter
- users should be able to favorite some shows and have them available after they restart the browser

## Requirements

- Must use latest version of React/React Native/Angular(please take into account what the role you are applying for has as a requirements)
- Must use CSS/SCSS to style component (use of a CSS framework is allowed and encouraged: ex Tailwind)
- API keys should not be hardcoded in the JS/TS files
- Project should contain linting config
- Must use good practices for code quality and  project file structure
- As a user I should be able to search for a title
- As a user I should be able to filter by year of release and by genre
- As a user I should be able to sort by name, year of release
- As a user I would like to be able to favorite a number of titles and I would like those favorite to persist in the browser (local is sufficient, no need for external APIs)
- My favorites should be accessible on a different route

## Nice to haves

- Unit tests
- Show movie poster
- Multi user (local) system
- Custom styling
- A favicon
- Github pages script and branch

## Deliverables

A Github repository that one our domain experts can **clone, install, build and run locally**. You can expect a domain expert to have a git client, NodeJS and NPM/Yarn installed and properly configured, no other dependencies should be required

## Miscellaneous

### The following choices are up to the person doing the exercise:

- Yarn or NPM
- CSS or SCSS
- State manager
- UI Framework
- Movie/Shows API provider
- Typescript or Javascript (please take into account what the role you are applying for has as a requirements)

### How long do I have to do this?

If it takes you more than two days please let us know, in our estimates it should only take a couple of hours

### What languages should the interface be in?

English only

### Who do I contact when I'm done?

The person that initially gave you the exercise link or email us at danfleser.dev@gmail.com and we will pick it up from there

### Who do I contact if I have questions?

Feel free to use Discord, Email, Linkedin or carrier pidgeon to get in touch with Dan or emails us at danfleser.dev@gmail.com

### Will this code be shown to the client?

Assume yes. Should also help us in reducing the time by clients evaluating profiles.
